# DP-vs-DnC-Analysis

This project explores the efficiency of different algorithmic design strategies by focusing on the computation of binomial coefficients, a fundamental concept in combinatorics and algebra widely utilized in various fields, including probability theory and computer science. The primary objective is to compare the execution time between two distinct approaches: Divide and Conquer (recursive approach) and Dynamic Programming across a range of input sizes, from small to large values, using Java.

The results from the experiments were measured in nanoseconds to capture the execution time of each method across different values of ‘n’ (size of the problem) and ‘k‘ (the binomial coefficient index).

Further details and project results are found in the `DPvsDnCReport.pdf` file attached.
